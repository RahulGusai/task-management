## Overview of the solution

In building this application, I have focused on prioritizing functionality over styling to ensure a robust and feature-rich user experience. The application implements all core milestones, including CRUD operations, pagination, filtering, and sorting on both default and custom columns. Additionally, users can dynamically add or remove custom fields in the schema. Despite the limited number of development hours, the design remains elegant and highly functional, ensuring a smooth and efficient workflow.

## Any Assumptions or Design Decisions
Below are some of the assumptions for this application
* A single filter rule can be applied per column. Supporting multiple rules for the same column with logical operations would require implementing a more advanced filtering engine.
* Custom fields added to the schema are not currently considered when creating or editing tasks. It can be extended for a more dynamic schema.
* Given the time constraints, the focus was on functionality rather than styling. The design follows a minimal and clean approach, prioritizing usability and feature completeness over visual appeal.


## Bonus Milestones

I have implemented a bulk delete feature with clear visual cues to enhance usability. Additionally, I considered implementing a Kanban board view and incorporating smooth animations to improve the user experience. However, due to time constraints, I had to prioritize core functionalities over these enhancements.


## Interesting Insights  

I previously built a Kanban view using pure CSS in one of my side projectsâ€”a web-based note-taking tool similar to Google Keep.

This assignment was both innovative and enjoyable. I'd love to discuss different approaches for enhancing it further!
